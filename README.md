Naturecoin is an altcoin for sustainable environment. The coin is based on blockchain system.
Not only blockchain system helps to reduce bureaucracy and fraud, make organization transparent and democratic, help track origins and the movements of products, Naturecoin can encourage people or institutions to adopt environmental practices.

## 1. Supply chain management
---
All supply and demand is recorded in blockchain server so the whole economy can be monitored.
This enables to release the adequate amount of currency in the economy. Also, it can be used to track products from producer to the storeshelf, showing which product has been made ethically or environment-friendly during developement process. In addition, it helps to prevent waste inefficiency, fraud, and unethical practices.

## 2. Recycling
---
Current recycling programs often give little or no incentive for people to participate. The responsibility for running these programs often falls on individual cities, and it can be difficult to track their impact. A recycling program on the blockchain would encourage participation by giving a financial reward in the form of cryptographic token in exchange for depositing recyclables(plastic containers, cans, or bottles). It would also make it easy to transparently track the amounts the materials recycled costs and profits and evaluate the impact of each participant in the program. Naturecoin is a token 2.0 system which reward recyclers throughout the world using [automated machines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGJ6al46fDw&t=39s)

## 3. Transparency
---
Blockchain technology enables users to send money without any bank account or mediator. There is no fee for transaction. Naturecoin does not require a fee to send the coin to others with blockchain technology.
